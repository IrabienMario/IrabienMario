# Projects

Within all my repositories, you will find a variety of projects spanning different domains, including those undertaken as academic assignments and others developed as personal initiatives to showcase the skills I have acquired. Below is a curated list of some of the noteworthy projects I have completed, along with details on my ongoing current project.

## MVC Product Manager

This project is academically oriented, focusing on the development of a software system designed to streamline and manage orders within a company. The core component is the Product Manager, an MVC program tailored for use by production teams to efficiently mark their production as completed, ensuring optimal production processes.

The project unfolds across three iterations, with the initial phase dedicated to documentation and subsequent iterations focused on updates and coding. For a more detailed overview, please explore the repository here.

## Curent Project

At the moment, I am actively engaged in the development of a software application designed to empower psychologists by enabling them to administer exams digitally. This software aims to replace the traditional paper-based format with a more user-friendly and family-oriented digital solution.
