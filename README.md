# About myself.


Hello, I'm Mario Irabien, a dedicated student at the Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán, actively involved in developing innovative projects to elevate my programming skills. I am eager to embrace new challenges and seek diverse experiences. Presently, I am immersed in personal software projects, aiming to refine my expertise.

I characterize myself as an individual committed to continuous self-improvement, with a passion for leading and assisting others in their endeavors, I am not one to stay in the same place for too long; I constantly seek new opportunities and strive for self-improvement. Throughout my time in high school, I actively sought ways to stand out by participating in various groups, including the student council and even taking on the role of shooting guard. During my leisure time, I find joy in acquiring new knowledge. Additionally, I currently serve as the coordinator of an apostolic youth group, contributing to an environment I genuinely appreciate.

I also hold an English certification, attaining a B2 level certified by Oxford Academy. In addition to this, I possess various certifications validating my diverse skill set. Feel free to explore the certifications folder within this branch for further details.

Feel free to explore more about me and the projects I've developed by checking out the various folders of the repository.
